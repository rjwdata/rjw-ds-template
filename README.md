## End to End Machine Learning Pipeline

The purpose of this repo is to provide a machine learning template for classification problems.  The files in the `src` folder aid in the ingestion, transformation, modeling, and deployment of machine learning models.    

![End to End Machine Learning Pipeline](artifacts/end_to_end_machine_learning_pipeline.png)

This template is built on the data science framework purposed by Hadley Wickham in R for Data Science. [[1]](#1)  The template guides the machine learning architech through the different stages of the pipeline.
